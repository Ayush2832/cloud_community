- DNS is a internet's directory. It translate human readable domain name such as google.com into machine learning IP addresses.

- When browser makes a dns query it asking a DNS resolver. This DNS resolver could be from ISP or popular DNS provide like Cloudfare 1.1.1.1 or Google 8.8.8.8

- If DNS resolver does not have the IP address of the domain name, then he will ask it from Authoritative name server.

- So to know how things works first lets learn about the DNS hierarchy
-------------------------
#### DNS hierarchy

- The root naem server store the IP addresses of the TLD name severs.

- TLD name server do not store the IP addresses of authoritative name servers but they store information about the authoritative name servers

- Authoritative name servers is like the ultimate reference book for a specific domain on the internet. It is where you can find the IP addresses of all the domain name available on internet.

## Lets see how dns resolution works

- We write `amazon.in`, the browser first check into its cache, if there is no ip then it makes an operating system call to get ip.

- If its not in OS cache too, it reaches to DNS resolver.

- DNS first check into cache, if its not there it ask the root name server.

- Here it checks the ip address of TOP LEVEL DOMAIN, here is `.in`

- Then DNS resolver goes to `.in` TLD nameserver and get information about the authorative name server of `amazon.in`.

- The DNS resolver reaches out at the authoritative name server of the `amazon.in` and here it will get the ip address of the link.

- At last it will return it to the browser.
